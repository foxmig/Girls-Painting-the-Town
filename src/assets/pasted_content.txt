The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
[line 70](#L70): The build failed with an error indicating that Rollup failed to resolve an import "/src/main.jsx" which can break the application at runtime. It suggests adding the module to `build.rollupOptions.external`.

### Solution
To resolve this error:
1. Verify that the file "src/main.jsx" is present in your repository and committed.
2. If the file is available, add it to the `build.rollupOptions.external` configuration to inform Rollup not to bundle it.
3. Add the following configuration to your `vite.config.js` file:
   
   ```javascript
   export default {
     build: {
       rollupOptions: {
         external: ['/src/main.jsx']
       }
     }
   };
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the Rollup error and successfully build your project on Netlify.
